Overarching Wants
    3D Graphics
        XXX
    Physics Engine
        Voxel Based worlds
    Sound
        Ideally would like to have sound be actual waves
    AI
        Ai basics 
    Importance 
    If the Ai is not important then its cullable and not required to be saved when the player leaves the area, and can be regenerated if the player returns
        To the World
            The ai who are need to keep the world stable
        To the Player
            The ai that would break immersion if missing when the player returns
    Networking
        Since the game will be cpu heavy the plan is to have the player help with the processing. Obviously one can not trust the players, so each player is given a trust level that means that the longer that the player has gone without lying ( hacking/editing the returned values) the less duplicate servers need to be used to verify there results 
        Can connect headless servers as verified servers whose outputs are trusted without verification or used as lie detection
